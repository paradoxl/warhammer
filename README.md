# Warhammer 40k dice and army list 
# The idea
- Warhammer 40k is a tabletop strategy game that has roots from Dungeons and Dragons. This game has many mechanics and can become quite complex with different rules applying to different units. There are several factions and sub factions that will be accounted for, each with a myriad of unique units.


# Features
- Intake a users army, units, and abilities along with the ability to roll a number of different dice. 

- Dice functionality would automatically apply statistics based on the unit selected. 

- Give a brief description and information on stats of each unit when selected.

- Prevent user from adding units that will surpass a predefined points limit (Each unit has a value that is added to determine the total "strength" of an army. Generally each small unit is worth 70-80 points with a total army costing 2000 points.)

- Give the user the ability to generate detachments of units within their army list. 

- Application will be intended for GUI using javafx but may be downgraded to CLI pending time.


# Notes
I had originally intended to do a character sheet generator for Dungeons and Dragons but felt that the application would not be of a scale large enough for this project.

Army lists for Warhammer 40k are more complex than a character sheet in Dungeons and Dragons and will therefore allow me a better chance to understand the object oriented approach.

a list of real world models (units) can be found on 
https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Warhammer-40-000 along with the factions and subfactions.

Games workshop currently has a paid application of something similar. This would be an inteded clone.
